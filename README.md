# Zotero Data Extraction

Zotero Data Extraction is a Python script for cleaning data

## Installation

One of the end goals is to make this more intuitive by providing a very simple GUI for just dropping a Zotero .sqlite DB, or implementing some command-line features. 
For now, you can just setup a VENV for this script :)

## Usage

The script only has one entry point at main for testing purposes, this will be changed of course as the project evolves. Because I'm thinking that a REST API would play nicely with this, 
we're probably just going to integrate this script for API endpoints in Flask or something.

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first
to discuss what you would like to change.

Please make sure to update tests as appropriate. (I have a backlog of tests to write myself...)
